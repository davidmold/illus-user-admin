        <div class="question">
          Do I need to send the agency an invoice so I can be paid?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No. The agency will create a self-bill for you once the job has been
          closed. This counts as your invoice to us. We use this self-bill to keep
          track of your payments.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">When will I be paid?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          We will pay you approximately 45 days after the end of the month the job
          was closed and invoiced. For example – If a job is closed and invoiced
          in June it is paid mid Aug, if it is closed and invoiced in July it is
          paid in mid Sept and so on. If you finish a job, please make sure the
          agent is aware so they can close for invoice, especially at the end of
          the month.

        <div class="question">
          How can I see what payments are expected or get copies of my
          self-bills?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          You can access your account and see when payments are expected and
          download self-bills for your business records from the POMS admin area.
          Here are the instructions for accessing the site:<br>
          <br>
          It has been in the pipeline for a long time, so it is with great
          happiness that we are introducing, in your private admin area, 2 new
          accounting features.

          <ol>
            <li>A place to download self bills if you need them</li>
            <li>An approximate date to expect payments.</li>
          </ol>
          To get there go to
          <a href="https://www.illustrationx.com/artist-login"
            >https://www.illustrationx.com/artist-login</a
          >
          (there is a forgotten username or password link if it has gone astray).
          Then select the “manage" tab and “commissions" from the menu, you will
          see a new tab called "Selfbills" which lists all your self-bills.<br>
          <br>
          There is a PDF icon at the end of each row for you to download the self-bill.<br>
          <br>
          Here are a couple of screen grabs so you know what to expect to see:

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
          Will I receive the full amount of the self-bill?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          That depends. If the self-bill is under $1500 USD or £1,000, then you
          will receive the full amount. If the client has not paid the invoice and
          it is over $1500/£1,000 then you will receive an advance of $1,500 or
          £1,000 until the client pays the invoice. If the client has paid the
          full amount of the invoice, then you will receive the full amount of the
          self-bill.

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
          I only received an advance of $1,500 or £1,000 – when will I receive
          the balance?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          We will pay you the balance once the client has paid the agency in full.
          Many clients have a complex approval system for invoices. It may take
          2-4 weeks in some cases for the client to approve the invoice for
          payment. Many USA based clients have payment terms of over 45 days.

        <div class="question">
          How will I know when a payment has been made to me?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          We will send out the self-bill and a payment notice after payments have
          been processed. Please allow 7-10 business days for the payment to be
          received to your account. Please notify
          <a href="mailto:accounts@illustrationx.com"
            >accounts@illustrationx.com</a

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
          My job order is in € but the self bill is in £ and is less than
          expected. Why is that?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Our job system uses an exaggerated exchange rate when converting to
          Pounds/Euros/CAD/AUD etc. This covers any changes of exchange rate that
          can occur. When the client pays us you will receive a second self bill
          with any extra amount that we have received and that should take the
          amount to closer to what you had expected. The selfbill will have the
          same job number but a new selfbill number. So you can rest assured that
          if we receive more than the original selfbill, you will receive it. We
          normally do these adjustments once a month and if the rate allows for a
          higher payment we will send you the new self bill.

      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">When does the client receive the invoice?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          The invoice is sent to the client 3 days after the job closes. The job
          may not close immediately as it may take a week or more for the agent to
          obtain all the necessary paperwork. Many clients have a complex approval
          system, and it can delay payments to the agency.

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
          The client has not paid the invoice – Can I contact the client and ask
          them to pay?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No, please do not contact the client and ask for payment. This can cause
          legal problems for the agency. Be assured accounts is chasing the client
          and will keep you informed of when payment can be expected.

        <div class="question">
          My bank account information has changed. Who do I contact?

        <div class="answer">
          Please send
          <a href="mailto:accounts@illustrationx.com">accounts@illustrationx.com</a>
          your new bank information as soon as the change is made. If a payment is
          sent to a closed account, you will have to wait until we get the funds
          back before a new payment will be made.

        <div class="question">
          Can accounts help me with tax preparation or statements for my
          accountant?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          No, accounts cannot help with any tax advice or preparation. Please
          provide your self-bills and payment notices to your accountant so they
          can prepare your taxes. Please keep the monthly payment notices as these
          are very time intensive for accounts to create and send.

        <div class="question">
          Will accounts send out annual statements for my business records?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Accounts will send out a monthly payment notice along with your
          self-bill. It is your responsibility to keep track of your income for
          business purposes. USA based artists will receive a 1099 at the end of
          January for IRS tax reporting.

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">What is AP?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          AP is Advertising Provision.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have earned £1,000/$1500 we start
          to charge £145 per quarter, (plus VAT if UK based) for marketing costs.<br>
          <br>
          Ideally this will be paid by standing order/direct debit on a quarterly
          or monthly basis. However, some artists choose the Advertising Provision
          (AP) which is a 5% deduction that comes off each job and sits in another
          account. It is not the advertising bill as such, but it sits in a
          separate account and pays for the quarterly bills. If there is surplus
          in your AP account you can have it back at any time or use it to pay for
          other marketing opportunities, such as pages in the Directory of
          Illustration or Workbook. You will get a yearly statement to keep track
          of this account. If payment is made quarterly by S/O then there is no
          need for the deductions.<br>
          <br>
          If the AP account becomes overdrawn then we
          will take the amount due from payments due to you.

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
          I signed up to be in the Directory of Illustration or entered a
          contest and must pay the agency a portion of the fee. How is this
          handled?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          When you agree to participate in any Directory or Contest the fee will
          come out of your next job. If you do not have a job large enough to
          cover the balance then a portion of the fee will be taken from each job
          until the balance is paid.
