      <li>The portfolio management area enables control of your web presence on illustrationx.com and animationx.com.</li>
      <li> It has been designed to make it easy to do, whilst giving the flexibility to show you off individually within the context of the site. </li>
      <li>Updating your portfolio is very important. Regular visitors/commissioners can quickly become blind to unchanged work, so letâ€™s keep them on their visual toes.</li>
      <li>You can get a broad feeling for which are your more popular images, by way of a counter that will rank them by the number of times the larger image is shown by the user clicks.
        his will vary depending on the complexity of your style.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From your <a :href="pflink" target="_blank">Home page</a> users of the site will be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> see up to 50 of your images on the Web portfolio.</li>
      <li>have a resource that enables them to print top quality encapsulated documents of between 20 and 40 selected works for presentations, meetings and reference.</li>
      <li>show your animation reels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once you have made changes to your portfolio it will go live within 24 hours.
